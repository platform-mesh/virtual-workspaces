## Repository Description
- `virtual-workspaces` provides custom KCP-backed virtual workspace APIs for Platform Mesh.
- It exposes API-server-style endpoints for Platform Mesh views such as content configuration and marketplace access.
- This is a Go API server repo built on [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) and Kubernetes apiserver libraries rather than controller-runtime-style reconciliation.
- Read the org-wide [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/platform-mesh/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for general conventions.

## Core Principles
- Keep changes small and local. Prefer the simplest change that fixes the real problem.
- Verify the affected path before finishing. Use targeted tests first.
- Prefer the existing `task` targets where available; otherwise use direct Go commands.
- Keep human-facing process details in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; keep this file focused on agent execution.

## Project Structure
- `api/v1alpha1`: API types for exposed resources.
- `cmd`: CLI entrypoints such as service startup.
- `pkg/apidefinition`: API registration and definition helpers.
- `pkg/authentication`, `pkg/authorization`: authn/authz behavior.
- `pkg/contentconfiguration`, `pkg/marketplace`: domain handlers for exposed resources.
- `pkg/proxy`, `pkg/storage`, `pkg/path`: request routing and backend access helpers.
- `pkg/config`: runtime configuration handling.
- `config/crd`, `config/resources`: generated resource output.

## Commands
- `go test ./...` — default test command.
- `go test ./... -run <name>` — narrow verification for a specific path.
- `go fmt ./...` — format Go code.
- `task manifests` — regenerate CRDs.
- `task generate` — regenerate API objects and resource output after API changes.
- `go run ./main.go start` — run the virtual workspace server locally.
- `task docker-build` — build the container image.
- `task docker:kind` — build, load, and restart the deployment in kind.

## Code Conventions
- Follow existing package boundaries before adding new abstractions.
- Keep API-server wiring in `cmd` and request-path-specific logic in the corresponding `pkg/*` package.
- Add or update `_test.go` files when changing behavior.
- When editing API types, regenerate derived output instead of hand-editing generated artifacts.
- Treat authentication, authorization, and proxying changes as high-risk; validate carefully.
- Keep logs structured and avoid logging credentials, tokens, or raw auth material.

## Generated Artifacts
- Run `task generate` after changing API types or CRD shape.
- Review changes in `config/crd` and `config/resources`.
- Do not mix unrelated manual edits into generated files.

## Do Not
- Edit generated CRD or resource output in `config/crd` or `config/resources` without running `task generate`.
- Treat broad authn/authz or proxy changes as routine refactors; verify them explicitly.

## Hard Boundaries
- Do not invent task targets or repo conventions that do not exist here.
- Ask before changing release flow, CI wiring, deployment shape, or Helm integration outside this repo.
- Be careful with broad authn/authz changes; prefer the narrowest possible fix and explicit verification.

## Human-Facing Guidance
- Use `README.md` for local certificate setup, startup arguments, and service context.
- Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution process, DCO, and broader developer workflow expectations.
